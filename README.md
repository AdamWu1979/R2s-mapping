# 2D gradient-echo modelling 

This repository contains scripts used in Soellradl et al for R2s estimation in presence of macroscopic field variations for 2D spoiled gradient-echo sequences. 

## Dependencies 

The scripts were tested with [MATLB R2016b](https://www.matlab.com). Besides the external tools, which are provided in the repository, [FSL 6.0.1](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) is required for phase unwrapping and brain extraction with BET.  

## Examples

### Forward simulation
The example shows the effect of the Glsice polarity on the dephasing of the signal in presence of a macroscopic field gradient Gz, which was used to generate Figure 3 in Soellrad et al, 2019. 

### R2s mapping
In this example R2s estimated with the proposed models in in Soellradl et al, 2019. Before running the example, the input data and the results (optional) have to be downloaded. Link will be provided soon.
